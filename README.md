# [Project 1: Survey on Masculinity in the USA](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devanshu.gupta3647/viz/MasculinitySurvey_16702528343170/Maindashboard)
This is the first project I did for my portfolio, where I built dashboards using a masculinity dataset.

* Data was taken from the masculinitysurvey dataset.
* The dataset: [Masculinity survey.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474295/Masculinity.survey.zip)
* Cleaned dataset: [Cleaned_masculinity_dataset.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474296/Cleaned_masculinity_dataset.csv), mainly this dataset was used.
* A portion of Cleaned dataset was used while building the project.
* This is how my dashboards look like:

This project was done on Jupyter Notebook, mainly based on Python. In this project, I've found some correlations between different fields of the given dataset.

* Data was taken from the movie dataset.
* The dataset: [movies.csv.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474382/movies.csv.zip)
* The project is mainly based on pandas(for data cleaning), numpy(for statistics), seaborn and matplotlib(for data visualization).
* Some of the visualizations from the project:
