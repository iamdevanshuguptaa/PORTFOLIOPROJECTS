# [Project 1: Movie Correlation Project](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/667a06e5f1d16db4807aa6b0cf7bcf79de11425f/moviecorrelationproject.ipynb)

This project was done on Jupyter Notebook, mainly based on Python. In this project, I've found some correlations between different fields of the given dataset.

* Data was taken from the movie dataset.
* The dataset: [movies.csv.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474382/movies.csv.zip)
* The project is mainly based on pandas(for data cleaning), numpy(for statistics), seaborn and matplotlib(for data visualization).
* Some of the visualizations from the project:

# [Project 2: Survey on Masculinity in the USA](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devanshu.gupta3647/viz/MasculinitySurvey_16702528343170/Maindashboard)
This is the first project I did for my portfolio, where I built dashboards using a masculinity dataset.

* Data was taken from the masculinitysurvey dataset.
* The dataset: [Masculinity survey.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474295/Masculinity.survey.zip)
* Cleaned dataset: [Cleaned_masculinity_dataset.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474296/Cleaned_masculinity_dataset.csv), mainly this dataset was used.
* A portion of Cleaned dataset was used while building the project.
* This is how my dashboards look like:

# [Project 3: London Bike Rides](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRides_17010780932340/LondonBikeRides?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This project consists of well-organised dashboard where I tried to visualize the avg. moving rides in London in different climatic conditions such as Temperature, Windspeed and weather.

* Total Rides between the selected range where dashboard automatically detect the min. and max. range for months and display visualization accordingly.
* Tried to pullout the use of "Tooltips" with finese so that whenever you hover over the timeline graph, you'll see two nice and clean barcharts for the selected range.
* Applied clear filters, so just play with it and enjoy!!!
* Dataset: London Bike rides Dataset (From Kaggle)

# [Project 4: Major Project-Covid-19](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/tree/main/Major%20Project-Covid-19)
You can download the required dataset from the following website-> [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## [File 1: Data Cleaning by python- covid-data-cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/main/Major%20Project-Covid-19/Covid-data-cleaning.ipynb) 

* In this file, I've dropped some unnecessary fields from the .csv file by using pandas.
* Divided the original dataset into two .csv files:
1. CovidDeaths.csv
2. CovidVaccinations.csv

You can find these datasets here- [Divided covid datasets.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476401/Divided.covid.datasets.zip).

Since I love python, I used Jupyter Notebook here. You can directly execute this step using MS-Excel.

## [File 2: Data Cleaning by MySQL- COVID PORTFOLIO PROJECT.sql](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/main/Major%20Project-Covid-19/COVID%20PORTFOLIO%20PROJECT.sql)

* Performed some basic operations and functions so that data can be easily explored and visualized by Tableau.
* Extracted 4 sub .csv files 
1. [Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476352/Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv),
2. [Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476355/Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv),
3. [Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476354/Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv) and
4. [Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476359/Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv)

## [File 3: Covid Dashboard.tbwx](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_16727675035610/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

* By using the 4 csv files extracted by SQL, I've visualized them on a single dashboard. Explore and play around with it.
Thank you!
* Glimpse to that dashboard->

# [Project 5: Data cleaning using MySQL- Nashville Housing Data](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/main/nashvilleDataCleaning.sql)

* Dataset: [Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476525/Nashville.Housing.Data.for.Data.Cleaning.xlsx.zip)
* Cleaned this dataset by using MySQL.
* Used CTE's.
* Atlast, deleted unused columns in the given dataset.


# [Project 6: Washington House Sales](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devanshu.gupta3647/viz/WashingtonHouseSales_17012368024790/KingCountyHouseSales)
The aim for this project is to find out the Daily avg. House Sales in King County, Washington between the May 2014 and May 2015. I have tried to categorize the house as per the views such as excellent, good, fair, etc. and conditions such as Fair-Badly worn, poor-worn out etc. with the help filters, in different zip codes.

* Dataset:- [HouseData.xlsx](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/13520731/HouseData.xlsx)
* Developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize Daily avg. House sales at specific zip codes.
* Distributed the house price, Bedrooms and Bathrooms using histograms followed by their views and conditions heatmap filtered by yr built, sqft. living and a nice calendar.
