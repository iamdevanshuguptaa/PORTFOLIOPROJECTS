# [Project 1: London Bike Rides](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRides_17010780932340/LondonBikeRides?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This project consists of well-organised dashboard where I tried to visualize the avg. moving rides in London in different climatic conditions such as Temperature, Windspeed and weather.

* Total Rides between the selected range where dashboard automatically detect the min. and max. range for months and display visualization accordingly.
* Tried to pullout the use of "Tooltips" with finese so that whenever you hover over the timeline graph, you'll see two nice and clean barcharts for the selected range.
* Applied clear filters, so just play with it and enjoy!!!
* Dataset: London Bike rides Dataset (From Kaggle)

# [Project 2: Survey on Masculinity in the USA](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devanshu.gupta3647/viz/MasculinitySurvey_16702528343170/Maindashboard)
This is the first project I did for my portfolio, where I built dashboards using a masculinity dataset.

* Data was taken from the masculinitysurvey dataset.
* The dataset: [Masculinity survey.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474295/Masculinity.survey.zip)
* Cleaned dataset: [Cleaned_masculinity_dataset.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474296/Cleaned_masculinity_dataset.csv), mainly this dataset was used.
* A portion of Cleaned dataset was used while building the project.
* This is how my dashboards look like:

# [Project 3: Movie Correlation Project](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/667a06e5f1d16db4807aa6b0cf7bcf79de11425f/moviecorrelationproject.ipynb)

This project was done on Jupyter Notebook, mainly based on Python. In this project, I've found some correlations between different fields of the given dataset.

* Data was taken from the movie dataset.
* The dataset: [movies.csv.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474382/movies.csv.zip)
* The project is mainly based on pandas(for data cleaning), numpy(for statistics), seaborn and matplotlib(for data visualization).
* Some of the visualizations from the project:

# [Project 4: Major Project-Covid-19](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/tree/main/Major%20Project-Covid-19)
You can download the required dataset from the following website-> [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## [File 1: Data Cleaning by python- covid-data-cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/main/Major%20Project-Covid-19/Covid-data-cleaning.ipynb) 

* In this file, I've dropped some unnecessary fields from the .csv file by using pandas.
* Divided the original dataset into two .csv files:
1. CovidDeaths.csv
2. CovidVaccinations.csv

You can find these datasets here- [Divided covid datasets.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476401/Divided.covid.datasets.zip).

Since I love python, I used Jupyter Notebook here. You can directly execute this step using MS-Excel.

## [File 2: Data Cleaning by MySQL- COVID PORTFOLIO PROJECT.sql](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/main/Major%20Project-Covid-19/COVID%20PORTFOLIO%20PROJECT.sql)

* Performed some basic operations and functions so that data can be easily explored and visualized by Tableau.
* Extracted 4 sub .csv files 
1. [Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476352/Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv),
2. [Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476355/Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv),
3. [Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476354/Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv) and
4. [Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476359/Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv)

## [File 3: Covid Dashboard.tbwx](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_16727675035610/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

* By using the 4 csv files extracted by SQL, I've visualized them on a single dashboard. Explore and play around with it.
Thank you!
* Glimpse to that dashboard->

# [Project 5: Data cleaning using MySQL- Nashville Housing Data](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/blob/main/nashvilleDataCleaning.sql)

* Dataset: [Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476525/Nashville.Housing.Data.for.Data.Cleaning.xlsx.zip)
* Cleaned this dataset by using MySQL.
* Used CTE's.
* Atlast, deleted unused columns in the given dataset.

# [Project 6: Analyzing TV Data - Python](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/46c0423a-4565-4523-9423-ec6e3b03c00a)

This project is based on the history of Super Bowl party. In this project, I've cleaned and explored the data mainly using Pandas. I've used Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization. You can show this project by clicking on the header.
